# SecureChat (backend)

SecureChat is a generic chat application that claims to be fast, secure and simple. Although it is written for a specific usecase in mind (chatting from over the Linux terminal with a dedicated python frontend), it can be used to power any simple chat system. 

But, given we have some 5,457,964,120 different chat apps on planet earth, why would you ever need this? Good question. I'll leave that as an exercise to the reader.
